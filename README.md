<h1>AmusingCamp</h1>
This is a very helpful Camping site, made with the help of Express.js, Node.js, Passport.js and MongoDb.
Through this site, you can make your own account, Login to it, add comments, rate campgrounds, and Edit & Delete them.
Here, I have used Restful routing technique, through which we can create Node.js apps easily and effectively.
